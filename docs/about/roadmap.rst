Roadmap
=======

Overview
--------

As of summer 2021 scipp is still in an "early preview" state.
The overall plan for the coming releases is to:

- Consolidate the existing generic functionality.
- Add missing generic functionality to provide a more complex toolbox.
- Weed out usability hurdles, to ensure the library's interface is easy to use.

At this point we do not have a fixed release cycle.
Instead we publish new releases when major feature additions or breaking changes have gone into scipp.

Upcoming milestones
-------------------

None planned.

Future direction and plans
--------------------------

We have a number of improvements in mind which we would like to consider and potentially introduce to scipp.
At this point we have not prioritized or scheduled any of these:

- More complete support for geometry-related operations such as rotations around axes.
- More complete set of functionality, systematically eliminating missing operations, and handling of missing cases in existing operations.
- `dask <https://dask.org/>`_ support.
- Support for `numpy's array-function API <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/arrays.classes.html#numpy.class.__array_function__>`_, for better interoperability.
